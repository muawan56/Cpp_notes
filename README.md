# Dynamic Memory Allocation Examples

This GitHub repository contains two C++ programs that demonstrate the concept of dynamic memory allocation. These programs showcase how to allocate and deallocate memory dynamically using the `new` and `delete` operators. Below, you'll find details about each program.

## Program 1: Splitting a Sentence into Words

- **File:** `Lec05-4.cpp`
- **Description:** This program takes a sentence as input, splits it into individual words, and stores them in a dynamic array. It demonstrates how to allocate memory for a dynamic 2D array of characters, split a sentence into words, and deallocate the memory properly.

## Program 2: Dynamic Memory Allocation and Deallocation

- **File:** `Lec05-5.cpp`
- **Description:** This program generates random sizes for dynamic integer arrays, allocates memory for these arrays, and then deallocates the memory. It showcases the use of `new` and `delete` operators for both single integers and arrays.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Compile and run the C++ programs (`Lec05-4.cpp` and `Lec05-5.cpp`) using a C++ compiler of your choice.

3. Observe how dynamic memory allocation and deallocation work in these examples.

## Notes

- Program 1 (`Lec05-4.cpp`) demonstrates dynamic memory allocation for a 2D character array (array of words) and splitting a sentence into individual words.

- Program 2 (`Lec05-5.cpp`) shows the dynamic allocation and deallocation of memory for integer arrays. It highlights the difference between using `delete` and `delete []` for single integers and arrays, respectively.
